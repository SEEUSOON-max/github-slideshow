Architecture :

RCNN :
a method where we use selective search to extract just 2000 regions from the image 

Faster RCNN : 

- Similar to Fast R-CNN, the image is provided as an input to a convolutional network which provides a convolutional feature map. 
- Instead of using selective search algorithm on the feature map to identify the region proposals,
   a separate network is used to predict the region proposals.
-  The predicted region proposals are then reshaped using a RoI poolinglayer which is then used to classify the
   image within the proposed region and predict the offset values for the bounding boxes.

---------Mask RCNN :

Mask R-CNN is basically an extension of Faster R-CNN. Faster R-CNN is widely used for object detection tasks. For a given image, 
it returns the class label and bounding box coordinates for each object in the image.

1.  we use the ResNet 101 architecture to extract features from the images in Mask R-CNN. 
    So, the first step is to take an image and extract features using the ResNet 101 architecture.

2. Region Proposal Network (RPN) - Now, we take the feature maps obtained in the previous step and apply a region proposal network (RPM). 
   This basically predicts if an object is present in that region (or not).

3. Region of Interest (RoI) - The regions obtained from the RPN might be of different shapes, right? Hence, we apply a pooling layer and 
   convert all the regions to the same shape. Next, these regions are passed through a fully connected network so that the class label 
   and bounding boxes are predicted

	Till this point, the steps are almost similar to how Faster R-CNN works. Now comes the difference between the two frameworks. 
	In addition to this, Mask R-CNN also generates the segmentation mask.
	we can use either use semantic segmentation[group segmentation] and instance segmentation[it classifies the objects]
